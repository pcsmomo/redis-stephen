				"description": "The wingback chair is a popular design that originated in England in the 1700s. It has large, curving wings that extend from the back of the chair to provide support for the user's head and neck. The Morris chair is a type of rocker chair that was first designed in England in 1866 by William Morris. It has a low seat and wide arms that allow users to relax in it like they would in a rocking chair. The ladderback chair is so named because of its distinctive vertical slats running down its back. This style of chair became popular in America during the 1800s, and it is still commonly used today as an indoor or outdoor dining room chair. The barrel chair gets its name from its shape, which is similar to that"
